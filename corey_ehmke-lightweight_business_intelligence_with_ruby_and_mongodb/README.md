# Lightweight Business Intelligence with Ruby and MongoDB

Long the provence of specialists in the hermetic world of enterprise software development, business intelligence (BI) is increasingly important to smaller, more agile companies and startups who need access to near-real-time information to make critical business decisions. With its support for aggregation and reduction of massive amounts of data and its flexible schemas, MongoDB is a great choice for creating lightweight, denormalized data stores optimized for BI, with the added bonus of peaceful co-existence with transactional data stores.

In this talk I will explore how you can use Ruby and MongoDB to capture and analyze data to monitor user behaviour, track key business performance indicators, and deliver value to stakeholders through simple and elegant querying and reporting interfaces.
